# tboi-project																					 0.1 test

NOTE :: REPENTANCE ONLY! I've tried to make it so the mod doesn't interfere with anything so pack merges wouldn't have to be necessary.
If you do want to merge it though, I've made it decently easy to do so with most of the things in their
own seperate files instead of a giant main.lua clump. Even then, yanno, good luck reading my damn code.

Downloading is as simple as Downloading the ZIP, extracting it and dragging it into a single folder inside mods

Currently at a very early stage, things are not finished. At all. It barely works and the code is cursed.

Compatible with Mods : </br>
* Old Wardrobe+ mod (adds in 6 new costumes for now)</br>
