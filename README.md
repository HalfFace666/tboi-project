# tboi-project																					 0.1.1 test

NOTE :: REPENTANCE ONLY! I've tried to make it so the mod doesn't interfere with anything so pack merges wouldn't have to be necessary.
If you do want to merge it though, I've made it decently easy to do so with most of the things in their
own seperate files instead of a giant main.lua clump. Even then, yanno, good luck reading my damn code.
