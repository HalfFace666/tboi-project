# tboi-project																					1.0.0 test

NOTE :: DO NOT BUNDLE THIS IN WITH OTHER WORKSHOP CREATIONS, PLS
I've tried to make it so the mod doesn't interfere with anything so pack merges wouldn't have to be necessary.
If you do want to merge it though, I've made it decently easy to do so with most of the things in their
own seperate files instead of a giant main.lua clump. Even then, yanno, good luck reading my damn code.

Oh yeah, and most things are changeable by going into the scripts/dgm_config.lua file or by downloading
the Mod Config Menu mod.
